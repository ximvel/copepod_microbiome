# Feeding strategy and dietary preference shape the microbiome of epipelagic copepods in a warm nutrient-impoverished ecosystem
 Copepod microbiome analysis

The obtained sequences were processed with R v.4.1.0 package "biostring” and DADA2 pipeline [dada2 tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html). Briefly, primer sequences were trimmed from the paired-end reads using ”biostring” and then, DADA2 was used for sequence.
This is in **copepod** *copepod*.

## ASVs proccessing
this refers to the following R code: `asv_analysis.R`. 
`taxa_data_new_data_2020.csv`

```
this is
very
long
code
```
I used the following 3 R scripts to generate the ASV tables:
* `code_a.R`
* `code_b.R`
* `code_c.R`
