# Copepod microbiome
Feeding strategy and dietary preference shape the microbiome of epipelagic copepods in a warm nutrient-impoverished ecosystem

The obtained sequences were processed with R v.4.1.0 package "biostring” and DADA2 pipeline [dada2 tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html). Briefly, primer sequences were trimmed from the paired-end reads using ”biostring” and then, DADA2 was used for sequence.
This is in **copepod** *copepod*.
